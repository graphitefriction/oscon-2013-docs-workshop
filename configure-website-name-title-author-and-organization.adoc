== Configure site identity

[source,yaml]
.+_config/site.yml+
name: Write__Adapt__
title: WriteAdapt - For People Who Love Content
org: Strategy Media
author: The Octocat
author_url: https://github.com/octocat
base_url: ''
ctx_path: ''

[.topic.source]
== Additional configuration to customize processor

[source,yaml]
.+_config/site.yml+
----
# append
interpolate: false #<1>
haml:
  :ugly: true #<2>
----
<1> Disables interpolation of Ruby variable expressions in content (e.g., `#{name}`)
<2> Disables pretty printing (indentation) of HTML output

[.topic.source]
== Clean and preview site to see changes

 $ rake clean preview

IMPORTANT: The clean step is required since a change to the configuration file, +_config/site.yml+, does not force pages to be regenerated automatically.

// end::content[]

== Next: Activate AsciiDoc content
